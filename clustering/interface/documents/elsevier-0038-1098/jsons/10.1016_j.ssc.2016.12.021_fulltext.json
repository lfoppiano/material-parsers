In order to facilitate comparison with earlier site symmetry analysis in cubic structure where mode analysis is provided for Z=1, in the present study also we can consider reduced unit cell with Z=1, which gives a total of 40 modes. Out of these, 16 are Raman active (8A g +8E g ) in comparison to 8 Raman active modes (2A g +2E g +4F g ) in cubic symmetry . According to factor group analysis, the F g mode in cubic structure splits in A g and E g mode in rhombohedral structure. Therefore, in rhombohedral structure a splitting of Fg mode and appearance of extra modes are expected according to site symmetry analysis, which is not observed in present study. Therefore, the structural transition indi- cated by the sudden changes in mode position and mode width around 8.5 GPa is isostructural in nature. It may be noted that the ab-initio studies [13] predicted a structural transition near 3-4 GPa. However, the predicted transition is with lowering symmetry from cubic Im-3 to rhombohedral R-3. In addition to the lowering in symmetry, the R-3 space group is non-centro-symmetric and hence the LO and TO modes are expected to be separated which is not observed. Thus we can conclude from our Raman studies that there is no symmetry lowering in both the compounds up to 20 GPa.
